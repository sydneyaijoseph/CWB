<!-- QUESTIONS:
1. How to add more space in between the links in the Navigation Bar?
2. How to make the links in the Navigation Bar clickable and direct to the different headings on the page?
3. How to change the fonts on the page?
4. How to make the buttons bigger and have more space in between them?
5. How to add a coloured bar behind alternating sections? For Example: Pink bar behind "See More Stuff" and "Find Us"
6. How to make social icons clickable and redirect to the actual social media links?
